.SH "NAME"
Monit \- utility for monitoring services on a Unix system
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBmonit\fR [options] {arguments}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBMonit\fR is a utility for managing and monitoring processes, programs,
files, directories and filesystems on a Unix system. Monit conducts
automatic maintenance and repair and can execute meaningful causal
actions in error situations. E.g. Monit can start a process if it does
not run, restart a process if it does not respond and stop a process if
it uses too much resources. You can use Monit to monitor files,
directories and filesystems for changes, such as timestamps changes,
checksum changes or size changes.
.PP
Monit is controlled via an easy to configure control file based on a
free-format, token-oriented syntax. Monit logs to syslog or to its own
log file and notifies you about error conditions via customisable alert
messages. Monit can perform various \s-1TCP/IP\s0 network checks, protocol
checks and can utilise \s-1SSL\s0 for such checks. Monit provides a \s-1HTTP\s0(S)
interface and you may use a browser to access the Monit program.
.SH "WHAT TO MONITOR?"
.IX Header "WHAT TO MONITOR?"
You can use Monit to monitor daemon \fBprocesses\fR or similar programs
running on localhost. Monit is particularly useful for monitoring
daemon processes, such as those started at system boot time. For
instance sendmail, sshd, apache and mysql. In contrast to many other
monitoring systems, Monit can act if an error situation should occur,
e.g.; if sendmail is not running, monit can start sendmail again
automatically or if apache is using too many resources (e.g. if a DoS
attack is in progress) Monit can stop or restart apache and send you an
alert message. Monit can also monitor process characteristics, such as
how much memory or cpu cycles a process is using.
.PP
You can also use Monit to monitor \fBfiles\fR, \fBdirectories\fR and
\&\fBfilesystems\fR on localhost. Monit can monitor these items for changes,
such as timestamps changes, checksum changes or size changes. This is
also useful for security reasons \- you can monitor the md5 or sha1
checksum of files that should not change and get an alert or perform an
action if they should change.
.PP
Monit can monitor \fBnetwork connections\fR to various servers, either on
localhost or on remote hosts. \s-1TCP, UDP\s0 and Unix Domain Sockets are
supported. Network test can be performed on a protocol level; Monit has
built-in tests for the main Internet protocols, such as \s-1HTTP, SMTP\s0 etc.
Even if a protocol is not supported you can still test the server
because you can configure Monit to send any data and test the response
from the server.
.PP
Monit can be used to test \fBprograms\fR or scripts at certain
times, much like cron, but in addition, you can test the exit
value of a program and perform an action or send an alert if the
exit value indicates an error. This means that you can use Monit
to perform any type of check you can write a script for.
.PP
Finally, Monit can be used to monitor general \fBsystem\fR resources
on localhost such as overall \s-1CPU\s0 usage, Memory and System Load.
.SH "GENERAL OPERATION"
.IX Header "GENERAL OPERATION"
The behaviour of Monit is controlled by command-line options
\&\fIand\fR a run control file, monitrc,
the syntax of which we describe in a later section. Command-line
options override \fI.monitrc\fR declarations.
.PP
The default location for \fImonitrc\fR is \fI~/.monitrc\fR. If this
file does not exist, Monit will try \fI/etc/monitrc\fR and a few
other places. See \s-1FILES\s0 for details. You can also
specify the control file directly by using the \fI\-c\fR command-line
switch to monit. For instance,
.PP
.Vb 1
\& $ monit \-c /var/monit/monitrc
.Ve
.PP
Before Monit is started the first time, you can test the control
file for syntax errors:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& $ monit \-t
\& $ Control file syntax OK
.Ve
.PP
If there was an error, Monit will print an error message to the
console, including the line number in the control file from where
the error was found.
.PP
Once you have a working Monit control file, simply start Monit from the
console, like so:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& $ monit
.Ve
.PP
You can change some configuration directives via command-line
switches, but for simplicity it is recommended that you put these
in the control file.
.PP
Monit will detach from the terminal and run as a background process,
i.e. as a daemon process. As a daemon, Monit runs in cycles; It monitor
services, then goes to sleep for a configured period, then wakes up and
start monitoring again in an endless loop.
.SS "Options"
.IX Subsection "Options"
The following options are recognized by Monit. However, it is
recommended that you set options (when applicable) directly in
the \fI.monitrc\fR control file.
.PP
\&\fB\-c\fR \fIfile\fR
   Use this control file
.PP
\&\fB\-d\fR \fIn\fR
   Run Monit as a daemon once per \fIn\fR seconds. Or use \fI\*(L"set
   daemon\*(R"\fR in monitrc.
.PP
\&\fB\-g\fR \fIname\fR
   Set group name for start, stop, restart, monitor, unmonitor,
   status and summary action.
.PP
\&\fB\-l\fR \fIlogfile\fR
   Print log information to this file. Or use \fI\*(L"set logfile\*(R"\fR
    in monitrc.
.PP
\&\fB\-p\fR \fIpidfile\fR
   Use this lock file in daemon mode. Or use \fI\*(L"set pidfile\*(R"\fR
    in monitrc.
.PP
\&\fB\-s\fR \fIstatefile\fR
   Write state information to this file. Or use \fI\*(L"set
   statefile\*(R"\fR in monitrc.
.PP
\&\fB\-I\fR
   Do not run in background (needed for run from init)
.PP
\&\fB\-i\fR

.PP
\&\fB\-r\fR
   Reset Monit's unique \s-1ID.\s0 Use with caution
.PP
\&\fB\-t\fR
   Run syntax check for the control file
.PP
\&\fB\-v\fR
   Verbose mode, work noisy (diagnostic output)
.PP
\&\fB\-vv\fR
   Very verbose mode, same as \-v plus log stack-trace on error
.PP
\&\fB\-H\fR \fI[filename]\fR
   Print \s-1MD5\s0 and \s-1SHA1\s0 hashes of the file or of stdin if the
   filename is omitted; Monit will exit afterwards
.PP
\&\fB\-V\fR
   Print version number and patch level
.PP
\&\fB\-h\fR
   Print a help text
.SS "Arguments"
.IX Subsection "Arguments"
Once you have Monit running as a daemon process, you can call
Monit with one of the following arguments. Monit will then
connect to the Monit daemon (on \s-1TCP\s0 port 127.0.0.1:2812 by
default) and ask the Monit daemon to perform the requested
action. In other words; calling monit without arguments starts
the Monit daemon, and calling monit \fIwith\fR arguments enables you
to communicate with the Monit daemon process.
.IP "start all" 4
.IX Item "start all"
Start all services listed in the control file and enable
monitoring for them. If the group option is set (\fI\-g\fR), only
start and enable monitoring of services in the named group (\*(L"all\*(R"
is not required in this case).
.IP "start name" 4
.IX Item "start name"
Start the named service and enable monitoring for it. The name is
a service entry name from the monitrc file.
.IP "stop all" 4
.IX Item "stop all"
Stop all services listed in the control file and disable their
monitoring. If the group option is set, only stop and disable
monitoring of the services in the named group (\*(L"all\*(R" is not
required in this case).
.IP "stop name" 4
.IX Item "stop name"
Stop the named service and disable its monitoring. The name is a
service entry name from the monitrc file.
.IP "restart all" 4
.IX Item "restart all"
Stop and start \fIall\fR services. If the group option is set, only
restart the services in the named group (\*(L"all\*(R" is not required in
this case).
.IP "restart name" 4
.IX Item "restart name"
Restart the named service. The name is a service entry name from
the monitrc file.
.IP "monitor all" 4
.IX Item "monitor all"
Enable monitoring of all services listed in the control file. If
the group option is set, only start monitoring of services in the
named group (\*(L"all\*(R" is not required in this case).
.IP "monitor name" 4
.IX Item "monitor name"
Enable monitoring of the named service. The name is a service
entry name from the monitrc file. Monit will also enable
monitoring of all services this service depends on.
.IP "unmonitor all" 4
.IX Item "unmonitor all"
Disable monitoring of all services listed in the control file. If
the group option is set, only disable monitoring of services in
the named group (\*(L"all\*(R" is not required in this case).
.IP "unmonitor name" 4
.IX Item "unmonitor name"
Disable monitoring of the named service. The name is a service
entry name from the monitrc file. Monit will also disable
monitoring of all services that depends on this service.
.IP "status [name]" 4
.IX Item "status [name]"
Print service status information.
.IP "summary [name]" 4
.IX Item "summary [name]"
Print a short status summary.
.IP "reload" 4
.IX Item "reload"
Reinitialise a running Monit daemon, the daemon will reread its
configuration, close and reopen log files.
.IP "quit" 4
.IX Item "quit"
Kill the Monit daemon process
.IP "validate" 4
.IX Item "validate"
Check all services listed in the control file. This action is
also the default behaviour when Monit runs in daemon mode.
.IP "procmatch regex" 4
.IX Item "procmatch regex"
Allows for easy testing of pattern for process match check. The
command takes regular expression as an argument and displays all
running processes matching the pattern.
.SH "THE MONIT CONTROL FILE"
.IX Header "THE MONIT CONTROL FILE"
Monit is configured and controlled via a control file called
\&\fImonitrc\fR. The default location for this file is ~/.monitrc. If this
file does not exist, Monit will try /etc/monitrc, then
\&\f(CW@sysconfdir\fR@/monitrc and finally ./monitrc. If you build Monit from
source, the value of \f(CW@sysconfdir\fR@ can be given at configure time as
\&./configure \-\-sysconfdir. For instance, using \fI./configure
\&\-\-sysconfdir /var/monit/etc\fR will make Monit search for \fImonitrc\fR in
\&\fI/var/monit/etc\fR
.PP
To protect the security of your control file and passwords the control
file must have read-write permissions \fIno more than 0700\fR
(u=xrw,g=,o=); Monit will complain and exit otherwise.
.PP
When there is a conflict between the command-line arguments and
the arguments in this file, the command-line arguments takes
precedence.
.PP
Monit uses its own Domain Specific Language (\s-1DSL\s0); The control
file consists of a series of service entries and global option
statements.
.PP
Comments begin with a \f(CW\*(Aq#\*(Aq\fR and extend through the end of the
line. Otherwise the file consists of a series of service entries or
global option statements in a free-format, token-oriented syntax.
.PP
You can use noise keywords like \f(CW\*(Aqif\*(Aq\fR, \f(CW\*(Aqand\*(Aq\fR, \f(CW\*(Aqwith(in)\*(Aq\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(Aqhas\*(Aq\fR, \f(CW\*(Aqus(ing|e)\*(Aq\fR, \f(CW\*(Aqon(ly)\*(Aq\fR, \f(CW\*(Aqthen\*(Aq\fR, \f(CW\*(Aqfor\*(Aq\fR, \f(CW\*(Aqof\*(Aq\fR
anywhere in an entry to make it resemble English. They're ignored, but
can make entries much easier to read at a glance. Keywords are case
insensitive.
.PP
There are three kinds of tokens: \fIgrammar\fR, \fInumbers\fR (i.e.
decimal digit sequences) and \fIstrings\fR. Strings can be either
quoted or unquoted. A quoted string is bounded by double quotes
and may contain whitespace (and quoted digits are treated as a
string). An unquoted string is any whitespace-delimited token,
containing characters and/or numbers.
.PP
On a semantic level, the control file consists of three types of
entries:
.IP "1. Global set-statements" 4
.IX Item "1. Global set-statements"
A global set-statement starts with the keyword \f(CW\*(C`set\*(C'\fR and the
item to configure.
.IP "2. Global include-statement" 4
.IX Item "2. Global include-statement"
The include statement consists of the keyword \f(CW\*(C`include\*(C'\fR and a glob
string. This statement is used to include configure directives from
separate files.
.IP "3. One or more service entry statements." 4
.IX Item "3. One or more service entry statements."
Each service entry consists of the keywords \f(CW\*(C`check\*(C'\fR, followed by the
service type. Each entry requires a \fBunique\fR descriptive name, which
may be freely chosen. This name is used by Monit to refer to the
service internally and in all interactions with the user.
.PP
Currently, nine types of check statements are supported:
.IP "1. \s-1CHECK PROCESS\s0 <unique name> <\s-1PIDFILE\s0 <path> | \s-1MATCHING\s0 <regex>>" 4
.IX Item "1. CHECK PROCESS <unique name> <PIDFILE <path> | MATCHING <regex>>"
<path> is the absolute path to the program's pid-file. A pid-file is a
file, containing a Process's unique \s-1ID.\s0 If the pid-file does not exist
or does not contain the \s-1PID\s0 number of a running process, Monit will
call the entry's start method if defined.
.Sp
<regex> is an alternative to using \s-1PID\s0 files and uses process name
pattern matching to find the process to monitor. The first match is
used so this form of check is most useful if the process name is
unique. Pid-file should be used where possible as it defines expected
pid exactly (pattern matching won't be useful for processes which start
a child process using fork/clone as the child will match the same
pattern temporarily). You can test if a process match a pattern from
the command-line using \f(CW\*(C`monit procmatch "regex\-pattern"\*(C'\fR. This will
lists all processes matching or not, the regex-pattern.
.IP "2. \s-1CHECK FILE\s0 <unique name> \s-1PATH\s0 <path>" 4
.IX Item "2. CHECK FILE <unique name> PATH <path>"
<path> is the absolute path to the file. If the file does not exist,
Monit will call the entry's start method if defined, if <path> does not
point to a regular file type (for instance a directory), Monit will
disable monitoring of this entry. If Monit runs in passive mode or the
start method is not defined, Monit will just send an alert on error.
.IP "3. \s-1CHECK FIFO\s0 <unique name> \s-1PATH\s0 <path>" 4
.IX Item "3. CHECK FIFO <unique name> PATH <path>"
<path> is the absolute path to the fifo. If the fifo does not exist,
Monit will call the entry's start method if defined, if <path> does not
point to a fifo type (for instance a directory), Monit will disable
monitoring of this entry. If Monit runs in passive mode or the start
method is not defined, Monit will just send an alert on error.
.IP "4. \s-1CHECK FILESYSTEM\s0 <unique name> \s-1PATH\s0 <path>" 4
.IX Item "4. CHECK FILESYSTEM <unique name> PATH <path>"
<path> is the path to the device/disk, mount point, file or a directory
which is part of a filesystem. It is recommended to use a block special
file directly (for example /dev/hda1 on Linux or /dev/dsk/c0t0d0s1 on
Solaris, etc.) If you use a mount point (for example /data), note if
the filesystem is unmounted the test will still be true because the
mount point exist.
.Sp
If the filesystem becomes unavailable, Monit will call the entry's
start method if defined. if <path> does not point to a filesystem,
Monit will disable monitoring of this entry. If Monit runs in passive
mode or the start method is not defined, Monit will just send an alert
on error.
.IP "5. \s-1CHECK DIRECTORY\s0 <unique name> \s-1PATH\s0 <path>" 4
.IX Item "5. CHECK DIRECTORY <unique name> PATH <path>"
<path> is the absolute path to the directory. If the directory does not
exist, Monit will call the entry's start method if defined. If <path>
does not point to a directory, monit will disable monitoring of this
entry. If Monit runs in passive mode or the start methods is not
defined, Monit will just send an alert on error.
.IP "6. \s-1CHECK HOST\s0 <unique name> \s-1ADDRESS\s0 <host address>" 4
.IX Item "6. CHECK HOST <unique name> ADDRESS <host address>"
The host address can be specified as a hostname string or as an
IP-address string on a dotted decimal format. Such as,
tildeslash.com or \*(L"64.87.72.95\*(R".
.IP "7. \s-1CHECK SYSTEM\s0 <unique name>" 4
.IX Item "7. CHECK SYSTEM <unique name>"
The \fIunique name\fR is usually the local host name, but any descriptive
name can be used. If you use the variable \f(CW$HOST\fR as the name, it will
expand to the hostname. This check allows one to monitor general system
resources such as \s-1CPU\s0 usage, total memory usage or load average. The
\&\fIunique name\fR is used as the system hostname in mail alerts and as
the initial name of the host entry in M/Monit.
.IP "8. \s-1CHECK PROGRAM\s0 <unique name> \s-1PATH\s0 <executable file> [\s-1TIMEOUT\s0 <number> \s-1SECONDS\s0]" 4
.IX Item "8. CHECK PROGRAM <unique name> PATH <executable file> [TIMEOUT <number> SECONDS]"
<path> is the absolute path to the executable program or script. The
status test allows one to check the
program's exit status. If the program does not finish executing within
<number> seconds, Monit will terminate it. The default program timeout
is 300 seconds (5 minutes). The output of the program is recorded and
made available in the User Interface and in alerts (up to 1kB).
.IP "9. \s-1CHECK NETWORK\s0 <unique name> <\s-1ADDRESS\s0 <ipaddress> | \s-1INTERFACE\s0 <name>>" 4
.IX Item "9. CHECK NETWORK <unique name> <ADDRESS <ipaddress> | INTERFACE <name>>"
<ipaddress> is the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the monitored network interface. It
is also possible to use interface name, such as \*(L"eth0\*(R" on Linux.
.SH "LOGGING"
.IX Header "LOGGING"
Monit will log status and error messages to a log file. Use the
\&\fIset logfile\fR statement in the monitrc control file. To setup
Monit to log to its own logfile, use e.g. \fIset logfile
/var/log/monit.log\fR. If \fBsyslog\fR is given as a value for the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-l\*(C'\fR command-line switch (or the keyword \fIset logfile syslog\fR
is found in the control file) Monit will use the \fBsyslog\fR system
daemon to log messages with a priority assigned to each message
based on the context. To turn off logging, simply do not set the
logfile in the control file (and of course, do not use the \-l
switch)
.PP
The format for logfile is:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    [date] priority : message
.Ve
.PP
for example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    [CET Jan  5 18:49:29] info : \*(Aqlocalhost\*(Aq Monit started
.Ve
.SH "DAEMON MODE"
.IX Header "DAEMON MODE"
Use
.PP
.Vb 1
\& set daemon n (where n is a number in seconds)
.Ve
.PP
to specify Monit's poll cycle length and run Monit in daemon
mode. You must specify a numeric argument which is a polling
interval in seconds. In daemon mode, Monit detaches from the
console, puts itself in the background and runs continuously,
monitoring each specified service and then goes to sleep for the
given poll interval, wakes up and start monitoring again in an
endless cycle.
.PP
Alternatively, you can use the \f(CW\*(C`\-d\*(C'\fR command line switch to set
the poll interval, but it is strongly recommended to set the poll
interval in your \fI~/.monitrc\fR file, by using \fIset daemon\fR.
.PP
Monit will then always start in daemon mode. If you do not use
this statement and do not start monit with the \-d option, Monit
will just run through the service checks once and then exit. This
might be useful in some situations, but Monit is primarily designed
to run as a daemon process.
.PP
Calling \f(CW\*(C`monit\*(C'\fR with a Monit daemon running in the background sends
a wake-up signal to the daemon, forcing it to check services
immediately. Calling \f(CW\*(C`monit\*(C'\fR with the quit argument will kill a
running Monit daemon process instead of waking it up.
.SH "INIT SUPPORT"
.IX Header "INIT SUPPORT"
The \f(CW\*(C`set init\*(C'\fR statement prevents Monit from transforming itself into
a daemon process. Instead Monit will run as a foreground process. (You
should still use \f(CW\*(C`set daemon\*(C'\fR to specify the poll cycle).
.PP
This is required to run Monit from init. Using init to start Monit is
probably the best way to run Monit if you want to be certain that you
always have a running Monit daemon on your system. Another option is to
run Monit from crontab. In any case, you should make sure that the
control file does not have any syntax errors before you start Monit
from init or crontab (use \f(CW\*(C`monit \-t\*(C'\fR to check).
.PP
To setup Monit to run from init, you can either use the \f(CW\*(C`set init\*(C'\fR
statement in Monit's control file or use the \f(CW\*(C`\-I\*(C'\fR option from the
command line. Here is what you must add to \f(CW\*(C`/etc/inittab\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  # Run Monit in standard run\-levels
\&  mo:2345:respawn:/usr/local/bin/monit \-Ic /etc/monitrc
.Ve
.PP
After you have modified init's configuration file, you can run
the following command to re-examine /etc/inittab and start Monit:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  telinit q
.Ve
.PP
For systems without telinit:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  kill \-1 1
.Ve
.PP
If Monit is used to monitor services that are also started at boot time
(e.g. services started via \s-1SYSV\s0 init rc scripts or via inittab) then,
in some cases, a race condition could occur. That is; if a service is
slow to start, Monit can assume that the service is not running and
possibly try to start it and raise an alert, while, in fact the service
is already about to start or already in its startup sequence. Please
see the \s-1FAQ\s0 for a solution to this problem. The short version is to
start Monit on a higher run-level after system processes.
.SH "INCLUDE FILES"
.IX Header "INCLUDE FILES"
The Monit control file, \f(CW\*(C`monitrc\*(C'\fR, can include additional
configuration files. This feature helps one to organise configuration
into separate files instead of having everything in one file, if you
like this kind of thing. Include statements can be placed at virtually
any place in \f(CW\*(C`monitrc\*(C'\fR though the convention is at the bottom. The
syntax is the following:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  include globstring
.Ve
.PP
The globstring is any kind of string as defined in \f(CWglob(7)\fR. Thus,
you can refer to a single file or you can load several files at
once. If you want to use whitespace in your string the globstring
needs to be embedded into quotes (') or double quotes ("). If the
globstring matches a directory instead of a file, it is silently
ignored.
.PP
Any \fIinclude\fR statements in an included file are parsed as in the
main control file.
.PP
If the globstring matches several results, the files are included in a
non sorted manner. If you need to rely on a certain order, you should
avoid wild-card globbing and instead specify the full path of files
included.
.PP
An example,
.PP
.Vb 1
\& include /etc/monit.d/*.cfg
.Ve
.PP
This will load any file matching the globstring. That is, all
files in \fI/etc/monit.d\fR that ends with the prefix \fI.cfg\fR.
.SH "SSL OPTIONS"
.IX Header "SSL OPTIONS"
Common \s-1SSL/TLS\s0 options can be set using the following statement and
will apply to all \s-1SSL\s0 connections made through Monit:
.PP
.Vb 8

\&  }
.Ve
.PP
\&\fI\s-1VERSION\s0\fR set the specific \s-1SSL/TLS\s0 version to use. By default Monit
uses \s-1AUTO.\s0 In \s-1AUTO\s0 mode, only \s-1TLS\s0 is used, SSLv2 and SSLv3 is
considered obsolete. If you have to use SSLv2 or SSLv3, you must
explicitly set the version.
.PP
\&\fI\s-1VERIFY\s0\fR enable \s-1SSL\s0 server certificate verification. This will verify
and report an error if the server certificate is not trusted, not valid
or has expired. By default certificate verification is disabled, though
we recommend enabling it, otherwise there is no guarantee that Monit
speaks with the server you think it speaks with.
.PP
\&\fI\s-1SELFSIGNED\s0\fR self-signed certificates are rejected by default. Use
this option to allow self-signed certificates.
.PP
\&\fI\s-1CLIENTPEMFILE\s0\fR set the path to the \s-1SSL\s0 client certificate
\&\*(L"database-file\*(R" in \s-1PEM\s0 format. If an \s-1SSL\s0 server requires client
certificate authentication, Monit will try to find a public key
certificate in this file which match the server's Certificate Authority
and if found, use this certificate for client authentication.
.PP
\&\fI\s-1CACERTIFICATEFILE\s0\fR set the path to the \s-1PEM\s0 encoded file containing
Certificate Authority (\s-1CA\s0) certificates. Monit uses OpenSSL's default
\&\s-1CA\s0 certificates if this options is not used (\fIopenssl version \-d\fR
can be used to get the default \s-1CA\s0 certificates). Many distributions comes
with \s-1SSL\s0 and \s-1CA\s0 certificates already setup and using this option is
normally not necessary.
.PP
\&\fI\s-1CACERTIFICATEPATH\s0\fR set the path to the directory containing
Certificate Authority (\s-1CA\s0) certificates. Monit uses OpenSSL's default
\&\s-1CA\s0 certificates if this options is not used. Many distributions comes
with \s-1SSL\s0 and \s-1CA\s0 certificates already setup and using this option is
normally not necessary.
.PP
The \s-1SSL\s0 options statement will globally apply to all \s-1SSL/TLS\s0 connection
made through Monit. \s-1SSL\s0 options can also be set in a local check, in
\&\fImailserver\fR settings or in the \fImmonit\fR statement, and will then
override or extend the global settings.
.PP
To set global \s-1SSL\s0 options, put this statement near the top of your
\&\fI.monitrc\fR file:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    set ssl options {...}
.Ve
.PP
Here is an example of setting both global and local \s-1SSL\s0 options:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    # Enable certificate verification for all SSL connections
\&    # Self\-signed certificates are not allowed by default
\&    set ssl options {

.Ve
.SH "MONIT HTTPD"
.IX Header "MONIT HTTPD"
If specified in the control file, Monit will start with \s-1HTTP\s0 support.
You can then use Monit \s-1CLI\s0 to start and stop services, disable or
enable service monitoring as well as view the status of each service.
.PP
If \s-1HTTP\s0 support is enabled over \s-1TCP\s0 rather than over a Unix Socket, you
can also view Monit's informative dashboard in your web browser.
.PP
Note that if \s-1HTTP\s0 support is disabled, the Monit \s-1CLI\s0 interface will
have reduced functionality, as most \s-1CLI\s0 commands (such as \*(L"monit
status\*(R") need to communicate with the Monit background process via
the \s-1HTTP\s0 interface. We strongly recommend having \s-1HTTP\s0 support enabled.
If security is a concern, bind the \s-1HTTP\s0 interface to local host only or
use Unix Socket so Monit is not accessible from the outside.
.PP
Syntax for \s-1TCP\s0 port:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&  SET HTTPD PORT <number> [ADDRESS <hostname | IP\-address>]
\&      [SSL <ENABLE | DISABLE>]
\&      [PEMFILE <path>]
\&      [CLIENTPEMFILE <path>]
\&      [ALLOWSELFCERTIFICATION]
\&      [SIGNATURE <ENABLE | DISABLE>]
\&      ALLOW <user:password | IP\-address | IP\-range>+
.Ve
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& set httpd port 2812
\&     allow username:password
.Ve
.PP
You can now use <http://localhost:2812/> to
access Monit's web interface from a browser, after you have entered
username and password as credentials.
.PP
Syntax for Unix Socket:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  SET HTTPD UNIXSOCKET <path>
\&      ALLOW <user:password>+
.Ve
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& set httpd unixsocket /var/run/monit.sock
\&     allow username:password
.Ve
.PP
\&\fBOptions\fR:
.PP
\&\fB\s-1UNIXSOCKET\s0\fR set the path to the Unix Socket Monit should bind to
and listen on.
.PP
\&\fB\s-1PORT\s0\fR set the port Monit should bind to and listen on. Monit is
usually setup on port 2812.
.PP
\&\fB\s-1ADDRESS\s0\fR make Monit listen on a specific interface only. For example
if you \fIdon't\fR want to expose Monit's web interface to the network,
bind it to localhost only. Monit will accept connections on any address
by default (if \s-1ADDRESS\s0 option is missing).
.PP
For example to limit the web interface to localhost only:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& set httpd
\&     port 2812
\&     use address 127.0.0.1
\&     allow username:password
.Ve
.PP
\&\fB\s-1SSL\s0\fR enable \s-1TLS\s0 for Monit's web interface. The \fI\s-1PEMFILE\s0\fR option
holds both the server's private key and certificate. This file should
be stored in a safe place on the filesystem and should have strict
permissions, no more than 0700.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.Vb 5
\& set httpd
\&     port 2812
\&     ssl enable
\&     pemfile /etc/certs/monit.pem
\&     allow myuser:mypassword
.Ve
.PP
You can now use <https://localhost:2812/> to
access the Monit web server over a \s-1TLS\s0 encrypted connection.
.PP
OpenSSL \s-1FIPS\s0 is supported. To enable \s-1FIPS\s0 mode (provided your OpenSSL
library supports it), add this statement to Monit control file:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& SET FIPS
.Ve
.PP
\&\fB\s-1CLIENTPEMFILE\s0\fR client certificate based authentication. A connecting
client has to provide a certificate known to Monit in order to connect.
This file also needs to have all necessary \s-1CA\s0 certificates. By default
self-signed client certificates are \fBnot\fR allowed. If you want to use
a self signed certificate from a client it has to be allowed explicitly
with the \fB\s-1ALLOWSELFCERTIFICATION\s0\fR statement.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.Vb 5
\& set httpd
\&     port 2812
\&     ssl enable
\&     pemfile /etc/certs/monit.pem
\&     clientpemfile /etc/certs/monit\-client.pem
.Ve
.PP
\&\fB\s-1SIGNATURE\s0\fR can be used to hide Monit version from the
\&\s-1HTTP\s0 response header and error pages. For example:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  set httpd
\&    port 2812
\&    signature disable
\&    allow myuser:mypassword
.Ve
.SS "Authentication"
.IX Subsection "Authentication"
Access to the Monit web interface is controlled primarily via the
\&\fB\s-1ALLOW\s0\fR option which is used to specify authentication and authorise
only specific clients to connect.
.PP
If the Monit command line interface is being used, at least one
cleartext password is necessary (see bellow), otherwise the Monit
command line interface will not be able to connect to the Monit
web interface.
.PP
Clients trying to connect to Monit, but submit a wrong username and/or
password are logged with their IP-address.
.PP
\fIClient certificates\fR
.IX Subsection "Client certificates"
.PP
This authentication method is a strong authentication mechanism and
employ \s-1HTTPS\s0 client certificates to verify the authenticity of a
connecting client. Clients must posses a Public Key Certificate known
by Monit. The client must connect to Monit over \s-1SSL\s0 and Monit ask the
client to send its certificate. Upon receiving the certificate Monit
compares the certificate to certificates located in the
\&\fI\s-1CLIENTPEMFILE\s0\fR file. Access is granted if the client certificate is
in this file. See \fI\s-1CLIENTPEMFILE\s0\fR above for details.
.PP
\fIHost and network allow list\fR
.IX Subsection "Host and network allow list"
.PP
Monit maintains an access-control list of hosts and networks allowed to
connect. You can add as many hosts as you want to, but only hosts with
a valid domain name or its \s-1IP\s0 address are allowed.
.PP
Monit will query a name server to check any hosts trying to connect. If
a host (client) is trying to connect, but cannot be found in the access
list or cannot be resolved, Monit will shutdown the connection to the
client promptly.
.PP
Control file example:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  set httpd port 2812
\&      allow localhost
\&      allow my.other.work.machine.com
\&      allow 10.1.1.1
\&      allow 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0
\&      allow 10.0.0.0/8
.Ve
.PP
Clients, not mentioned in the allow list, trying to connect to Monit
will be denied access and are logged with their IP-address.
.PP
\fIBasic Authentication\fR
.IX Subsection "Basic Authentication"
.PP
Monit supports Basic Authentication as described in \s-1RFC 2617.\s0
.PP
In short; a server challenge a client (e.g. a Browser) to send
authentication information (username and password) and if accepted, the
server will allow the client access to the requested document.
.PP
The biggest weakness with Basic Authentication is that username and
password is sent in clear-text over the network (i.e. base64 encoded).
It is therefor recommended that you do not use this authentication
method unless you run Monit with \fIssl\fR support. With ssl, it is safe
to use Basic Authentication since \fIall\fR \s-1HTTP\s0 data, including Basic
Authentication headers will be encrypted.
.PP
Cleartext user and password
.IX Subsection "Cleartext user and password"
.PP
Monit will use Basic Authentication if an allow statement contains a
username and a password separated with a single ':' character. Special
characters can be used, but for non-alphanumerics the password has to
be quoted.
.PP
Syntax:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& ALLOW <username>:<password>
.Ve
.PP
\s-1PAM\s0
.IX Subsection "PAM"
.PP
\&\s-1PAM\s0 is supported on platforms which provide \s-1PAM \s0(such as Linux,
Mac \s-1OS X,\s0 FreeBSD, NetBSD).
.PP
Syntax:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& ALLOW @<group>
.Ve
.PP
where \f(CW\*(C`group\*(C'\fR is the group name allowed to access Monit's web
interface. Monit uses a \s-1PAM\s0 service called \fImonit\fR for \s-1PAM\s0
authentication, see the \s-1PAM\s0 manual page for detailed instructions on
how to set the \s-1PAM\s0 service and \s-1PAM\s0 authentication plugins.
.PP
Sample \s-1PAM\s0 service for Monit on Mac \s-1OS X \s0(store as
\&\*(L"/etc/pam.d/monit\*(R" file):
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  # monit: auth account password session
\&  auth       sufficient     pam_securityserver.so
\&  auth       sufficient     pam_unix.so
\&  auth       required       pam_deny.so
\&  account    required       pam_permit.so
.Ve
.PP
And monitrc config which only allows group \f(CW\*(C`admin\*(C'\fR authenticated via
\&\s-1PAM\s0 to access the web interface:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  set httpd
\&      port 2812
\&      allow @admin
.Ve
.PP
htpasswd file
.IX Subsection "htpasswd file"
.PP
Alternatively you can use files in \f(CW\*(C`htpasswd\*(C'\fR format (one
\&\fIuser:passwd\fR entry per line), like so: \fIallow [cleartext|crypt|md5]
/path [users]\fR. By default cleartext passwords are read. In case the
passwords are digested it is necessary to specify the cryptographic
method. If you do not want all users in the password file to have
access to Monit you can specify only those users that should have
access, in the allow statement. Otherwise all users are added.
.PP
Example1:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  set httpd port 2812
\&      allow hauk:password
\&      allow md5 /etc/httpd/htpasswd john paul ringo george
.Ve
.PP
If you use this method together with a host list, then only
clients from the listed hosts will be allowed to connect to the
Monit \s-1HTTP\s0 server and each client will be asked to provide a
username and a password.
.PP
Example2:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  set httpd port 2812
\&      allow localhost
\&      allow 10.1.1.1
\&      allow hauk:"passw@rd"
.Ve
.PP
If you only want to use Basic Authentication, then just provide
allow entries with username and password or password files as in
example 1 above.
.PP
Read-only users
.IX Subsection "Read-only users"
.PP
Finally it is possible to define some users as read-only. A
read-only user can read the Monit web pages but will \fInot\fR get
access to push-buttons and cannot change a service from the web
interface.
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  set httpd port 2812
\&      allow admin:password
\&      allow hauk:password read\-only
\&      allow @admins
\&      allow @users read\-only
.Ve
.PP
A user is set to read-only by using the \fIread-only\fR keyword
\&\fBafter\fR username:password. In the above example the user \fIhauk\fR
is defined as a read-only user, while the \fIadmin\fR user has all
access rights.
.SH "ALERT MESSAGES"
.IX Header "ALERT MESSAGES"
Monit will raise an alert in the following situations:
.PP
.Vb 10

To get an alert via e\-mail, set the alert target using the global \f(CW\*(C`set
alert\*(C'\fR statement (for all services) or the \f(CW\*(C`alert\*(C'\fR statement in the
context of a service entry (for a single service).
.SS "Setting an alert recipient"
.IX Subsection "Setting an alert recipient"
If an event occurs, Monit will send an alert. There are two kinds of
alert statement: global and local.
.PP
Global syntax:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& SET ALERT mail\-address [[NOT] {event, ...}] [REMINDER cycles]
.Ve
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& set alert foo@bar
.Ve
.PP
will send a default email to the address foo@bar whenever any event
occurs on any service.
.PP
If you want to send alert messages to more email addresses, add a
\&\f(CW\*(C`set alert \*(Aqemail\*(Aq\*(C'\fR statement for each address.
.PP
It is also possible to use the local alert statement in the context of
a service check to enable alert for the given service only:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& ALERT mail\-address [[NOT] {event, ...}] [REMINDER cycles]
.Ve
.PP
Local alert example:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& check host myhost with address 1.2.3.4
\&     if failed port 3306 protocol mysql then alert
\&     if failed port 80 protocol http then alert
\&     alert foo@baz # Local service alert
.Ve
.PP
You can combine global and local alert statements. If there is a
conflict, the local alert has precedence and overrides the global
statement.
.PP
\fISetting an event filter\fR
.IX Subsection "Setting an event filter"
.PP
If you only want an alert message sent for certain events, list
them in an \f(CW\*(C`{event, ...}\*(C'\fR block, e.g.:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& set alert foo@bar only on { timeout, nonexist }
.Ve
.PP
The event list can also be negated to send alerts for all events
\&\fIexcept\fR those which are listed, by prepending the list with the word
\&\f(CW\*(C`not\*(C'\fR. For example, to receive all alerts except notification about
Monit program start and stop:

Each alert recipient can have it's own filter, for example:

\fISetting an error reminder\fR
.IX Subsection "Setting an error reminder"
.PP
Monit by default sends just \fIone\fR notification if a service failed and
another when/if it recovers. If you want to be notified that the service
is still in a failed state, you can use the reminder option in the
alert statement:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& SET ALERT mail\-address [WITH] REMINDER [ON] number [CYCLES]
.Ve
.PP
For example if you want to be notified each tenth cycle if a service
remains in a failed state, you can use:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& alert foo@bar with reminder on 10 cycles
.Ve
.PP
Likewise if you want to be notified on each failed cycle, you can
use:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  alert foo@bar with reminder on 1 cycle
.Ve
.SS "Disabling alerts for some service"
.IX Subsection "Disabling alerts for some service"
To suppress alerts for some user and service, add the \f(CW\*(C`noalert\*(C'\fR
statement in the context of a service check.
.PP
.Vb 1
\& NOALERT mail\-address
.Ve
.PP
Example (send all alerts to foo@bar except for service p3):
.PP
.Vb 1
\& set alert foo@bar
\&
\& check process p1 with pidfile /var/run/p1.pid
\&
\& check process p2 with pidfile /var/run/p2.pid
\&
\& check process p3 with pidfile /var/run/p3.pid
\&     noalert foo@bar
.Ve
.SS "Message format"
.IX Subsection "Message format"
The alert message format can be modified by using the \f(CW\*(C`set
mail\-format\*(C'\fR statement:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& SET MAIL\-FORMAT {mail\-format}
.Ve
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 8
\& set mail\-format {
\&      from: monit@foo.bar
\&  reply\-to: support@domain.com
\&   subject: $SERVICE $EVENT at $DATE
\&   message: Monit $ACTION $SERVICE at $DATE on $HOST: $DESCRIPTION.
\&            Yours sincerely,
\&            monit
\& }
.Ve
.PP
The \fIfrom:\fR option is the sender's email address. That is, the email
address Monit will pretend it is sending alerts from. It does not have
to be a real email-address only a proper formatted address.
.PP
The \fIreply-to:\fR option can be used to set the reply-to mail header.
.PP
The \fIsubject:\fR option sets the message subject and must be on only
\&\fIone\fR line.
.PP
The \fImessage:\fR option sets the mail body. This option should always
be the last in a mail-format statement. The mail body can be as long
as needed, but must \fInot\fR contain the block-closing '}' character.
.PP
You need not use all options, only the option which you want to
override. For example to globally change the senders address only:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& set mail\-format { from: bofh@foo.bar }
.Ve
.PP
The subject and body may contain \f(CW$NAME\fR variables, which are expanded by
Monit. Here is a list of variables that can be used when composing an
alert message.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI\f(CI$EVENT\fI\fR
.Sp
A string describing the event that occurred.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI\f(CI$SERVICE\fI\fR
.Sp
The service name
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI\f(CI$DATE\fI\fR
.Sp
The current time and date (\s-1RFC 822\s0 date style).
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI\f(CI$HOST\fI\fR
.Sp
The name of the host Monit is running on
.IP "\(bu" 4

.Sp
The description of the error condition
.SS "Setting a mail server for alert delivery"
.IX Subsection "Setting a mail server for alert delivery"
The mail server Monit should use to send alert messages is
defined with a \f(CW\*(C`set mailserver\*(C'\fR statement:
.PP
.Vb 9
\& SET MAILSERVER
\&        <hostname|ip\-address>
\&        [PORT number]
\&        [USERNAME string] [PASSWORD string]
\&        [using SSL [with options {...}]
\&        [CERTIFICATE CHECKSUM [MD5|SHA1] <hash>],
\&        ...
\&   [with TIMEOUT X SECONDS]
\&   [using HOSTNAME hostname]
.Ve
.PP
Multiple mail servers can be set by using a comma separated list. If
Monit cannot connect to the first server, it will try the next in
the list and so on.
.PP
The port statement allows to override the default \s-1SMTP\s0 port
(465 for \s-1SSL,\s0 or 25 for \s-1TLS\s0 and non secure connection).
.PP
Monit supports \s-1AUTH PLAIN\s0 and \s-1AUTH LOGIN\s0 for \s-1SMTP\s0 authentication.
You can set a username and a password using the \s-1USERNAME\s0 and
\&\s-1PASSWORD\s0 options.
.PP
You can set \s-1SSL/TLS \s0options for the connection and 
also check a \s-1SSL\s0 certificate checksum.
.PP
The default connection timeout is 5 seconds. You can rise this
limit using the \s-1TIMEOUT\s0 option.
.PP
Example (setting two mail servers for failover):
.PP
.Vb 1
\& set mailserver smtp.gmail.com, smtp.other.host
.Ve
.PP
By default, Monit uses the local host name in \s-1SMTP HELO/EHLO\s0 and in the
Message-ID header. You can override this using the \s-1HOSTNAME\s0 option.
.SS "Event queue"
.IX Subsection "Event queue"
If no mail server is available, Monit \fIcan\fR queue events in the
local file-system for retry until the mail server recovers.
.PP
If Monit is used with M/Monit, the event queue provides a safe
event store for M/Monit in the case of temporary problems.
.PP
The event queue is persistent across Monit restarts and provided that
the back-end filesystem is persistent, across system restart as well.
.PP
By default, the queue is disabled and if the alert handler fails, Monit
will simply drop the alert message.
.PP
To enable the event queue, add the following statement:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& SET EVENTQUEUE BASEDIR <path> [SLOTS <number>]
.Ve
.PP
The <path> is the path to the directory where events will be
stored.
.PP
Optionally if you want to limit the queue size, use the slots
option to only store up to \fInumber\fR event messages.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  set eventqueue basedir /var/monit slots 5000
.Ve
.PP
If you are running more then one Monit instance on the same
machine, you \fBmust\fR use separated event queue directories.
.SH "SERVICE METHODS"
.IX Header "SERVICE METHODS"
Each service can have associated \fIstart\fR, \fIstop\fR and \fIrestart\fR
methods which Monit can use to execute action on the service.
.PP
Syntax:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& <START | STOP | RESTART> [PROGRAM] = "program"
\&        [[AS] UID <number | string>]
\&        [[AS] GID <number | string>]
\&        [[WITH] TIMEOUT <number> SECOND(S)]
.Ve
.PP
If the \f(CW\*(C`program\*(C'\fR is a shell script it must begin with \f(CW\*(C`#!\*(C'\fR and
the remainder of the first line must specify an interpreter for
the program. e.g. \f(CW\*(C`#!/bin/sh\*(C'\fR
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`program\*(C'\fR must also be executable (for example mode 0755).
.PP
It's possible to write scripts directly into the \fIprogram\fR this
way:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& stop = "/bin/bash \-c \*(Aqkill \-s SIGTERM \`cat /var/run/process.pid\`\*(Aq"
.Ve
.PP
By default the program is executed as the user under which Monit
is running. If Monit is running as root, you may optionally specify
the \fI\s-1UID\s0\fR and \fI\s-1GID\s0\fR the executed program should switch to.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& check process mmonit with pidfile /usr/local/mmonit/mmonit/logs/mmonit.pid
\&   start program = "/usr/local/mmonit/bin/mmonit" as uid "mmonit" and gid "mmonit"
\&   stop program = "/usr/local/mmonit/bin/mmonit stop" as uid "mmonit" and gid "mmonit"
.Ve
.PP
In the case of a process check, Monit will wait up to 30 seconds for
the start/stop action to finish before giving up and report an error.
You can override this timeout using the \fI\s-1TIMEOUT\s0\fR option.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& check process foobar with pidfile /var/run/foobar.pid
\&   start program = "/etc/init.d/foobar start" with timeout 60 seconds
\&   stop program = "/etc/init.d/foobar stop"

Limitations:
.PP
The current scheduler is poll cycle based. When a service check is
constraint with the \fIevery cron\fR statement, Monit will check whether
the current time match the cron-string pattern. If it does, the check
is performed, otherwise it is skipped. The cron specification thus does
not guarantee when exactly the test will run, this depends on the
default poll time and the length of the check cycle. In other words, we
cannot guarantee that Monit will run on a specific time. Therefor we
\&\fBstrongly\fR recommend to use an asterix in the minute field or at
minimum a range, e..g. 0\-15. \fBNever\fR use a specific minute as Monit
may not run on that minute.
.PP
We will address this limitation in a future release and convert the
scheduler from serial polling into a parallel non-blocking scheduler
where checks are guaranteed to run on time and with seconds resolution.
.SH "SERVICE GROUPS"
.IX Header "SERVICE GROUPS"
Service entries in the control file, \fImonitrc\fR, can be grouped
together by the \fIgroup\fR statement. The syntax is simply (keyword
in capital):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  GROUP groupname
.Ve
.PP
With this statement it is possible to group similar service
entries together and manage them as a whole. Monit provides
functions to start, stop, restart, monitor and unmonitor a
group of services, like so:
.PP
To start a group of services from the console:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  monit \-g <groupname> start
.Ve
.PP
To stop a group of services:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  monit \-g <groupname> stop
.Ve
.PP
To restart a group of services:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  monit \-g <groupname> restart
.Ve
.PP
A service can be added to multiple groups by using more than one group
statement:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  group www
\&  group filesystem
.Ve
.SH "SERVICE MONITORING MODE"
.IX Header "SERVICE MONITORING MODE"
Monit supports three monitoring modes per service: \fIactive\fR,
\&\fIpassive\fR and \fImanual\fR.
.PP
Syntax:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  MODE <ACTIVE | PASSIVE | MANUAL>
.Ve
.PP
In \fIactive\fR mode (the default), Monit will pro-actively monitor a
service and in case of problems raise alerts and/or restart
the service.
.PP
In \fIpassive\fR mode, Monit will passively monitor a service and will
raise alerts, but will \fBnot\fR try to fix a problem by executing
\&\fIstart\fR, \fIstop\fR or \fIrestart\fR.
.PP
In \fImanual\fR mode, Monit will enter \fIactive\fR mode \fIonly\fR if a
service was started via Monit:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  monit start <servicename>
.Ve
.PP
Use \*(L"monit stop <servicename>\*(R" to stop the service and take it out
of Monit's control. The manual mode can be used to build a simple
cluster with active/passive HA-services.
.PP
A service's monitoring state is persistent across Monit restart.
.PP
If you use Monit in a HA-cluster you should place the Monit state file
in a temporary filesystem so if the machine which runs HA-services
should crash and the stand-by machine take over its services, the
HA-services won't be started after the crashed node will boot again:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  set statefile /tmp/monit.state
.Ve
.SH "SERVICE RESTART LIMIT"
.IX Header "SERVICE RESTART LIMIT"
\&\fBMonit\fR provides a restart limit mechanism for situations
where a service simply refuses to start or respond over a longer
period.
.PP
The restart limit mechanism is based on number of service restarts and
number of poll-cycles. For example, if a service had \fIx\fR
restarts within \fIy\fR poll-cycles (where \fIx\fR <= \fIy\fR) then Monit
will perform an action (for example unmonitor the service). If a
timeout occurs, Monit will send an alert message if you have
register interest for this event.
.PP
The syntax for the timeout statement is as follows (keywords are
in capital):
.PP
.Vb 1
\& IF <number> RESTART <number> CYCLE(S) THEN <action>
.Ve
.PP
The \fIaction\fR value is either one of common actions or
\&\s-1TIMEOUT \s0(for backward compatibility, equals to \s-1UNMONITOR\s0 action).
.PP
Here is an example where Monit will unmonitor the service if it was
restarted 2 times within 3 cycles:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& if 2 restarts within 3 cycles then unmonitor
.Ve
.PP
To have Monit check the service again after monitoring was disabled,
run \f(CW\*(C`monit monitor servicename\*(C'\fR from the command line.
.PP
Example for setting custom exec on timeout:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& if 5 restarts within 5 cycles then exec "/foo/bar"
.Ve
.PP
Example for stopping the service:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& if 7 restarts within 10 cycles then stop
.Ve
.SH "SERVICE DEPENDENCIES"
.IX Header "SERVICE DEPENDENCIES"
If specified in the control file, Monit can do dependency
checking before start, stop, monitoring or unmonitoring of
services. The dependency statement may be used within any service
entries in the Monit control file.
.PP
The syntax for the depend statement is simply:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& DEPENDS on service[, service [,...]]
.Ve
.PP
Where \fBservice\fR is a check service entry name used in your \f(CW\*(C`.monitrc\*(C'\fR
file, for instance \fBapache\fR or \fBdatafs\fR.
.PP
You may add more than one service name of any type or use more
than one depend statement in an entry.
.PP
Services specified in a \fIdepend\fR statement will be checked
during stop/start/monitor/unmonitor operations.
.PP
If a service is stopped or unmonitored it will stop/unmonitor any
services that depends on itself.
.PP
If the service is started, all services which this service depends on
will be started before starting this service. if start of some service
failed, the service with prerequisites will \s-1NOT\s0 be started and the, but
will remember that it should start and will retry next cycle.
.PP
If a service is restarted, it will first stop any active services that
depend on it and after it is started, start all depending services that
were active before the restart again.
.PP
Here is an example where we set up an apache service entry to
depend on the underlying apache binary. If the binary should
change an alert is sent and apache is not monitored anymore. The
rationale is security and that Monit should not execute a
possibly cracked apache binary.
.PP
.Vb 6
\& (1) check process apache with pidfile "/var/run/httpd.pid"
\& (2)    depends on httpd
\& (3)    ...
\& (4)
\& (5) check file httpd with path /usr/bin/httpd
\& (6)    if failed checksum then stop
.Ve
.PP
The first entry is the process entry for apache. The second line sets
up a dependency between this entry and the service entry named httpd in
line 5. A dependency tree works as follows, if an action is conducted in
a lower branch it will propagate upward in the tree and for every dependent
entry execute the same action. In this case, if the checksum should fail in
line 6 then an stop action is executed and apache binary is not checked
anymore. But since the apache process entry depends on the httpd entry
this entry will also execute the stop action. In short, if the
checksum test for the httpd binary file should fail, both the check
file httpd and the check process apache entry are stopped.
.PP
A dependency tree is a general construct and can be used between all
types of service entries and span many levels and propagate any
supported action (except the exec action which will not propagate
upward in a dependency tree for obvious reasons).
.PP
Here is another different example. Consider the following common
server setup:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  WEB\-SERVER \-> APPLICATION\-SERVER \-> DATABASE \-> FILESYSTEM
\&      (a)               (b)             (c)          (d)
.Ve
.PP
You can set dependencies so that the web-server depends on the
application server to run before the web-server starts and the
application server depends on the database server and the
database depends on the filesystem to be mounted before it
starts. See also the example section below for examples using the
depend statement.
.PP
Here we describe how Monit will function with the above
dependencies:
.IP "If no services are running" 4
.IX Item "If no services are running"
Monit will start the servers in the following order: \fId\fR, \fIc\fR,
\&\fIb\fR, \fIa\fR
.IP "If all servers are running" 4
.IX Item "If all servers are running"
When you run 'monit stop all' this is the stop order: \fIa\fR, \fIb\fR,
\&\fIc\fR, \fId\fR. If you run 'Monit stop d' then \fIa\fR, \fIb\fR and \fIc\fR
are also stopped because they depend on \fId\fR and finally \fId\fR is
stopped.
.IP "If \fIa\fR does not run" 4
.IX Item "If a does not run"
Monit will start \fIa\fR
.IP "If \fIb\fR does not run" 4
.IX Item "If b does not run"
Monit will first stop \fIa\fR then start \fIb\fR and finally start \fIa\fR if
\&\fIb\fR is up again.
.IP "If \fIc\fR does not run" 4
.IX Item "If c does not run"
Monit will first stop \fIa\fR and \fIb\fR then start \fIc\fR and finally start
\&\fIb\fR then \fIa\fR.
.IP "If \fId\fR does not run" 4
.IX Item "If d does not run"
Monit will first stop \fIa\fR, \fIb\fR and \fIc\fR then start \fId\fR and finally
start \fIc\fR, \fIb\fR then \fIa\fR.
.IP "If the control file contains a depend loop." 4
.IX Item "If the control file contains a depend loop."
A depend loop is for example; a\->b and b\->a or a\->b\->c\->a.
.Sp
When Monit starts it will check for such loops and complain and
exit if a loop was found. It will also exit with a complaint if a
depend statement was used that does not point to a service in the
control file.
.SH "SERVICE TESTS"

.PP
Monit provides several tests you can use in a 'check' statement to test
a service.
.PP
You can test either for some expected value or range and take
actions if the value changed.
.PP
General syntax for testing a specific value or range:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& IF <TEST> THEN ACTION [ELSE IF SUCCEEDED THEN ACTION]
.Ve
.PP
The action is evaluated each time the <\s-1TEST\s0> condition is true. Success
action is optional and executed only when the state changes from
failure to success. If success action is not set, Monit will send a
recovery alert by default.
.PP
General syntax for a value change test:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& IF CHANGED <TEST> THEN ACTION
.Ve

The action is executed each time the value changes. Monit will remember
the new value and will trigger event if the value change again.
.PP
\fI\s-1ACTION\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "ACTION"
.PP
In each test you must select the action to be executed from this
list:

.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fB\s-1RESTART\s0\fR restarts the service \fBand\fR send an alert. Restart is
performed by calling the service's registered restart method or by
first calling the stop method followed by the start method if restart

.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fB\s-1STOP\s0\fR stops the service by calling the service's registered

will not be checked by Monit anymore nor restarted again later.
To reactivate monitoring of the service again you must explicitly
enable monitoring from the web interface or from the console.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fB\s-1EXEC\s0\fR can be used to execute an arbitrary program \fBand\fR send
an alert. If you choose this action you must state the program to
be executed and if the program require arguments you must enclose
the program and its arguments in a quoted string. You may
optionally specify the uid and gid the executed program should
switch to upon start. For instance:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& exec "/usr/local/tomcat/bin/startup.sh"
\&      as uid nobody and gid nobody
.Ve
.Sp
Remember, if Monit is run by root, then all programs executed by Monit
will be started with superuser privileges unless the uid and gid
extension is used.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fB\s-1UNMONITOR\s0\fR will disable monitoring of the service \fBand\fR send
an alert. The service will not be checked by Monit anymore nor
restarted again later.  To reactivate monitoring of the service
you must explicitly enable monitoring from the web interface or
from the console.
.PP
\fI\s-1FAILURE TOLERANCE\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "FAILURE TOLERANCE"
.PP
By default the action is executed if it matches and the service set in
an error state. However, you can require a test to fail more than once
before the error event is triggered and the service state changed to
failed. This is useful to avoid getting alerts on spurious errors,
which can happen, especially with network tests.
.PP
Syntax:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& FOR <X> CYCLES ...
.Ve
.PP
or:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& <X> [TIMES WITHIN] <Y> CYCLES ...
.Ve
.PP
The condition can be used both for failure and success action.
.PP
The first, simpler and recommended format requires \f(CW\*(C`X\*(C'\fR consecutive
events before switching the state:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& if failed
\&    port 80
\&    for 3 cycles
\& then alert
.Ve
.PP
The second format is more advanced and allows to tolerate intermittent
issues, but still catch excessive problems, where the service is
flapping between error and success states frequently.
.PP
For example if every second cycle fails (1\-0\-1\-0\-1\-0\-...), then \*(L"for 2
cycles\*(R" condition will never match, despite the service having
problems. The following statement will catch such a state:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& if failed
\&    port 80
\&    for 3 times within 5 cycles
\& then alert
.Ve
.PP
Example which sets multiple error levels and actions:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& check filesystem rootfs with path /dev/hda1
\&  if space usage > 80% for 5 times within 15 cycles then alert
\&  if space usage > 90% for 5 cycles then exec \*(Aq/try/to/free/the/space\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
Note: the maximum value for cycles is 64.

.SS "\s-1RESOURCE TESTING\s0"
.IX Subsection "RESOURCE TESTING"
Monit can examine how much system resources a service is using.
This test can only be used within a system or process service
entry in the Monit control file.
.PP
Depending on system or process characteristics, services can be
stopped or restarted and alerts can be generated. Thus it is
possible to utilise systems which are idle and to spare system
under high load.
.PP
The full syntax for a resource-statement used for resource
testing is as follows (keywords are in capital and optional
statements in [brackets]),
.PP
.Vb 1

MEMORY\*(R", \*(L"LOADAVG\s0([1min|5min|15min])\*(R". Some resource tests can be used
inside a check system entry, some in a check process entry and some in
both:
.PP
System only resource tests:
.PP
\&\s-1CPU\s0([user|system|wait]) is the percent of time the system spend
in user or kernel space and I/O. The user/system/wait modifier is
optional, if not used, the total system cpu usage is tested.
.PP
\&\s-1SWAP\s0 is the swap usage of the system in either percent (of the
systems total) or as an amount (Byte, kB, \s-1MB, GB\s0).
.PP
Process only resource tests:
.PP
\&\s-1CPU\s0 is the \s-1CPU\s0 usage of the process itself (percent).
.PP
\&\s-1TOTAL CPU\s0 is the total \s-1CPU\s0 usage of the process and its children
in (percent). You will want to use \s-1TOTAL CPU\s0 typically for
services like Apache web server where one master process forks
child processes as workers.
.PP
\&\s-1CHILDREN\s0 is the number of child processes of the process.
.PP
\&\s-1TOTAL MEMORY\s0 is the memory usage of the process and its child
processes in either percent or as an amount (Byte, kB, \s-1MB, GB\s0).
.PP
System and process resource tests:
.PP
\&\s-1MEMORY\s0 is the memory usage of the system or of a process (without
children) in either percent (of the systems total) or as an
amount (Byte, kB, \s-1MB, GB\s0).
.PP
\&\s-1LOADAVG\s0([1min|5min|15min]) refers to the system's load average.
The load average is the number of processes in the system run
queue, averaged over the specified time period.

.PP
\&\fIvalue\fR is either an integer or a real number (except for
\&\s-1CHILDREN\s0). For \s-1CPU, TOTAL CPU, MEMORY\s0 and \s-1TOTAL MEMORY\s0 you need to
specify a \fIunit\fR. This could be \*(L"%\*(R" or if applicable \*(L"B\*(R" (Byte),
\&\*(L"kB\*(R" (1024 Byte), \*(L"\s-1MB\*(R" \s0(1024 KiloByte) or \*(L"\s-1GB\*(R" \s0(1024 MegaByte).

.PP
To calculate the cycles, a counter is raised whenever the
expression above is true and it is lowered whenever it is false
(but not below 0). All counters are reset in case of a restart.
.PP
The following is an example to check that the \s-1CPU\s0 usage of a
service is not going beyond 50% during five poll cycles. If it
does, Monit will restart the service:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& if cpu is greater than 50% for 5 cycles then restart
.Ve
.SS "\s-1FILE CHECKSUM TESTING\s0"
.IX Subsection "FILE CHECKSUM TESTING"
The checksum statement may only be used in a file service
entry and can be used to check the file's \s-1MD5\s0 or \s-1SHA1\s0 checksum.
.PP
Check specific checksum:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& IF FAILED [MD5|SHA1] CHECKSUM [EXPECT checksum] THEN action
.Ve
.PP
Check any file changes:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& IF CHANGED [MD5|SHA1] CHECKSUM THEN action
.Ve
.PP
The choice of \s-1MD5\s0 or \s-1SHA1\s0 is optional. \s-1MD5\s0 features a 128 bits checksum
(32 bytes hex encoded string) and \s-1SHA1\s0 a 160 bits checksum (40 bytes
hex encoded string). If this option is omitted, Monit will try to guess
the method from the \s-1EXPECT\s0 string or use \s-1MD5\s0 as the default checksum.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`expect\*(C'\fR is optional and if used, specifies the md5 or sha1 string
Monit should expect when testing a file's checksum. Monit will then not
compute an initial checksum for the file, but instead use the string
you submit. For example:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& if failed
\&    checksum expect 8f7f419955cefa0b33a2ba316cba3659

.Ve
.PP
You can, for example, use the \s-1GNU\s0 utility \fI\fImd5sum\fI\|(1)\fR or
\&\fI\fIsha1sum\fI\|(1)\fR to create a checksum string for a file and
use this string in the expect-statement.

.Ve
.PP
\&\fIregex\fR is a string containing the extended regular expression.
See also \fIregex\fR\|(7).

.PP
You can use the \fI\s-1NOT\s0\fR statement to invert a match.
.PP
On startup the read position is set to the end of the file
and Monit continues to scan to the end of the file on each cycle.
.PP
If the file size should decrease or inode changed, the read
position is set to the start of the file.
.PP
Only lines ending with a newline character are inspected.
.PP
Only the first 511 characters of a line are inspected.
.PP
.Vb 1
\& IGNORE [NOT] MATCH {regex|path}
.Ve
.PP
Lines matching an \fI\s-1IGNORE\s0\fR are not inspected during later

\&\fI\s-1IF MATCH\s0\fR.
.PP
All \fI\s-1IGNORE MATCH\s0\fR statements are evaluated first, in the

.IX Subsection "SPACE TESTING"
Monit can test a filesystem or a disk for space usage. This test may
only be used in the context of a filesystem service type.
.PP
Filesystems usually have some space reserved for the root user (ca.
1\-5%), so non-superusers cannot write to a nearly full filesystem. If
you set a limit for the filesystem which is used by non-root users you
might want to consider these reserved blocks when setting the limit.
You can use Monit itself to view the reserved blocks percentage by

Example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& check program myscript with path /usr/local/bin/myscript.sh
\&       if status != 0 then alert
.Ve
.PP
Sample script for the above example (/usr/local/bin/myscript.sh):
.PP
.Vb 3
\& #!/bin/bash
\& echo test
\& exit $?
.Ve
.PP
You can also send parameters with the program:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& check program list\-files with path "/bin/ls \-lrt /tmp/"
\&       if status != 0 then alert
.Ve
.PP
Arguments to the program or script is a sequence of whitespace
separated strings. In the above example the strings '\-lrt' and '/tmp/'
are arguments to the program '/bin/ls'. If arguments are used, it is
recommended to use quotes \fB"\fR to enclose the string, otherwise, if no
arguments are used, quotes are not needed.
.PP
Notes: If the program is a script, the interpreter is required
in the first line. The program or script must also be executable.
.PP
If Monit is run as the super user, you can optionally run the program
as a different user and/or group. In this example we run the \fIls\fR
program as user www and as group staff:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& check program ls with path "/bin/ls /tmp" as uid "www"
\&          and gid "staff"
\&       if status != 0 then alert
.Ve
.PP
Monit will execute the program periodically and if the exit status of
the program does not match the expected result, Monit can perform an
action. In the example above, Monit will raise an alert if the exit
value is different from 0. By convention, 0 means the program exited
normally.
.PP
Program checks are asynchronous. Meaning that Monit will not wait for
the program to exit, but instead, Monit will start the program in the
background and immediately continue checking the next service entry in
\&\fImonitrc\fR. At the next cycle, Monit will check if the program has
finished and if so, collect the program's exit status. If the status
indicate a failure, Monit will raise an alert message containing the
program's error (stderr) output, if any. If the program has not exited
after the first cycle, Monit will wait another cycle and so on. If the
program is still running after 5 minutes, Monit will kill it and
generate a program timeout event. It is possible to override the
default timeout (see the syntax below).
.PP
The asynchronous nature of the program check allows for
non-blocking behaviour in the current Monit design, but it comes
with a side-effect: when the program has finished executing and
is waiting for Monit to collect the result, it becomes a
so-called \*(L"zombie\*(R" process. A zombie process does not consume
any system resources (only the \s-1PID\s0 remains in use) and it is
under Monit's control and the zombie process is removed from the
system as soon as Monit collects the exit status. This means that
every \*(L"check program\*(R" will be associated with either a running
process or a temporary zombie. This unwanted zombie side-effect
will be removed in a later release of Monit.
.PP
Multiple status tests can be used, for example:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& check program hwtest with path /usr/local/bin/hwtest.sh
\&       with timeout 500 seconds
\&       if status = 1 then alert
\&       if status = 3 for 5 cycles then exec "/usr/local/bin/emergency.sh"

.SS "\s-1NETWORK PING TEST\s0"
.IX Subsection "NETWORK PING TEST"
Monit can perform a network ping test by sending \s-1ICMP\s0 echo request
datagram packets to a host and wait for the reply. This test can
only be used within a check host statement. Monit must also run as
the root user in order to be able to perform the ping test (because
the ping test must use raw sockets which usually only the super user
is allowed to).

Syntax:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  IF FAILED PING[4|6]
\&     [COUNT number] [SIZE number] [WITH] [TIMEOUT number SECONDS]
\&  THEN action
.Ve
.PP
If a \s-1DNS\s0 host name was used in the \fIcheck host\fR statement and the host
name resolve to several addresses (either IPv4 or IPv6), Monit will
ping the first available address and continue with the next address
until one connection succeed or until there are no more addresses left
to try. You can force Monit to only ping IPv4 or IPv6 addresses by
using the \s-1PING4\s0 or the \s-1PING6\s0 keyword instead of \s-1PING.\s0
.PP
The \fB\s-1COUNT\s0\fR parameter specifies how many consecutive ping requests
will be sent to the host in one cycle at maximum. The default value is 3.
.PP
The \fB\s-1SIZE\s0\fR parameter specifies the ping request data size. Default
is 64 bytes.
.PP
If no reply arrive within \fB\s-1TIMEOUT\s0\fR seconds, Monit reports an error.
If at least one reply was received, the ping test is considered a
success.
.PP
Monit will, by default, send up to \fIthree\fR ping request packets in
one cycle to prevent false alarm (i.e. up to 66% packet loss is
tolerated). You can set the \fB\s-1COUNT\s0\fR option to a value between 1 and
20 to send more or fewer packets. If you require 100% ping success,
set the count to 1 (i.e. just one request will be sent, and if the
packet was lost an error will be reported).
.PP
Note that many ISPs have started to filter out ping or \s-1ICMP\s0 packets
now, in which case there will be no reply from the host.
.PP
If a ping test is used in a check host entry, this test is run first
and if the test should fail, we assume that the connection to the
host is down and Monit will \fInot\fR continue with any subsequent port
tests.
.PP
Example:

.PP
If Monit does not support the protocol spoken by the server,
you can write your own protocol-test using \fIsend\fR and \fIexpect\fR
strings. The \fI\s-1SEND\s0\fR statement sends a string to the server port
and the \fI\s-1EXPECT\s0\fR statement compares a string read from the
server with the string given in the expect statement.
.PP
Syntax:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& [{SEND|EXPECT} "string"]+
.Ve
.PP
Monit will send a string as it is, and you \fBmust\fR remember to
include \s-1CR\s0 and \s-1LF\s0 in the string sent to the server if the protocol
expects such characters to terminate a string (most text based
protocols used over Internet do).
.PP
Monit will by default read up to 255 bytes from the server and
use this string when comparing the \s-1EXPECT\s0 string. You can override
the default value by using this statement at the top of the Monit
configuration file:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& SET EXPECTBUFFER <number> ["b"|"kb"]
.Ve
.PP
Max value for the expect buffer is 100 kb. For example, to set
the expect buffer to read 10 kilobytes:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& set expectbuffer 10 kb
.Ve
.PP
You can use non-printable characters in a \s-1SEND\s0 string if needed.
Use the hex notation, \e0xHEXHEX to send any char in the range
\&\e0x00\-\e0xFF, that is, 0\-255 in decimal. For example, to test a
Quake 3 server:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& send "\e0xFF\e0xFF\e0xFF\e0xFFgetstatus"
\& expect "sv_floodProtect|sv_maxPing"
.Ve

If your system supports \s-1POSIX\s0 regular expressions, you can use
regular expressions in the \s-1EXPECT\s0 string, see \fIregex\fR\|(7) to learn
more about the types of regular expressions you can use in an
expect string.
.PP
Since both regex and string compare operates on a zero terminated
string, you cannot test for '\e0' in an \s-1EXPECT\s0 buffer since this
character marks the end of the buffer. However, we escape '\e0' in
the expect buffer as \*(L"\e0\*(R" which you can test for. That is, '\e'
followed by the ascii value for 0. For instance, here is how to
test for an expect string that starts with zero followed by any
number of characters.
.PP
.Vb 1
\& expect "^[\e\e]0.*"
.Ve
.PP
Here is a simple \s-1SMTP\s0 protocol example:
.PP
.Vb 7
\& if failed
\&    port 25 and
\&    expect "^220.*"
\&    send   "HELO localhost.localdomain\er\en"
\&    expect "^250.*"
\&    send   "QUIT\er\en"
\& then alert
.Ve
.PP
\&\s-1SEND/EXPECT\s0 can be used with any socket type, such as \s-1TCP\s0 sockets,
\&\s-1UNIX\s0 sockets and \s-1UDP\s0 sockets.

\s-1HTTP\s0
.IX Subsection "HTTP"
.PP
Syntax:
.PP
.Vb 6
\& PROTO(COL) HTTP
\&     [REQUEST "string"]
\&     [STATUS operator number]
\&     [CHECKSUM checksum]
\&     [HTTP HEADERS list of headers]
\&     [CONTENT {= | != } STRING]
.Ve
.PP
\&\fI\s-1REQUEST\s0\fR option can set an \s-1URL\s0 string specifying a document on the
\&\s-1HTTP\s0 server. If the request statement isn't specified, the default \*(L"/\*(R"
page will be requested.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.Vb 5
\& if failed
\&    port 80
\&    protocol http
\&    request "/data/show?a=b&c=d"
\& then restart
.Ve
.PP
\&\fI\s-1STATUS\s0\fR option can be used to explicitly test the \s-1HTTP\s0 status code
returned by the \s-1HTTP\s0 server. If not used, the \s-1HTTP\s0 protocol test will
fail if the status code returned is greater than or equal to 400. You
can override this behaviour by using the \fIstatus\fR qualifier.
.PP
For example to test that a page does \fBnot\fR exist (the \s-1HTTP\s0 server
should return 404 in this case):
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  if failed
\&     port 80
\&     protocol http
\&     request "/non/existent.php"
\&     status = 404
\&  then alert
.Ve
.PP
\&\fI\s-1CHECKSUM\s0\fR You can test the checksum of documents returned by a \s-1HTTP\s0
server. Either \s-1MD5\s0 or \s-1SHA1\s0 hash can be used. Monit will \fBnot\fR test the
checksum for a document if the server does not set the \s-1HTTP
\&\s0\fIContent-Length\fR header. A \s-1HTTP\s0 server should set this header when it
server a static document (i.e. a file). There are no limitation on the
document size, but keep in mind that Monit will use time to download the
document over the network to compute the checksum.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 6
\& if failed
\&    port 80
\&    protocol http
\&    request "/page.html"
\&    checksum 8f7f419955cefa0b33a2ba316cba3659
\& then alert
.Ve
.PP
\&\fI\s-1HTTP HEADERS\s0\fR can be used to send a list of any \s-1HTTP\s0 headers
with a \s-1HTTP\s0 protocol test. For instance, the host header. If the
host header is not set, Monit will use the hostname or IP-address
of the host as specified in the check host statement. Specifying
a host header is useful if you want to connect to and test a
name-based virtual host. The syntax for setting \s-1HTTP\s0 headers is
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  http headers [name:value, name:value,..]
.Ve
.PP
where each name:value pair is separated with ','. If you need to
use ':' in the value string, for instance to set port number for a
host header, you must enclose the value in quotes. For example,
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  http headers [Host: "mmonit.com:443"]
.Ve
.PP
In a check host context, using this statement might look like
.PP
.Vb 7
\&  check host mmonit.com with address mmonit.com
\&    if failed
\&       port 80 protocol http
\&       with http headers [Host: mmonit.com, Cache\-Control: no\-cache,
\&         Cookie: csrftoken=nj1bI3CnMCaiNv4beqo8ZaCfAQQvpgLH]
\&       and request /monit/ with content = "Monit [0\-9.]+"
\&    then alert
.Ve
.PP
Setting \s-1HTTP\s0 headers is associated with the \s-1HTTP\s0 protocol test
and must come before \fIrequest\fR as in the example above.
.PP
\&\fI\s-1CONTENT\s0\fR option sets the pattern which is expected in the data
returned by the server. If the pattern doesn't match, event is
triggered.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  if failed
\&     port 80
\&     protocol http
\&     content = "foobar [0\-9.]+"
\&  then alert

Each of these limits can be compared against a value relative
to the total number of active Apache child processes.
.PP
You can combine all of these tests into one expression or you can
choose to test a certain limit only. If you combine the limits you
must connect them together using the \s-1OR\s0 keyword.

The simplest form is just the check statement. In this example we
check to see if our web server is running and log a message if not:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& check process nginx with pidfile /var/run/nginx.pid
.Ve
.PP
To have Monit start the server if it's not running, add a start
statement:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& check process nginx with pidfile /var/run/nginx.pid
\&       start program = "/etc/init.d/nginx start"
.Ve
.PP
Here's a more advanced example for monitoring an apache web-server
listening on the default port number for \s-1HTTP\s0 and \s-1HTTPS.\s0 In this
example Monit will restart apache if it's not accepting connections at
the port numbers. The method Monit use for restart is to first execute
the stop-program, then wait (up to 30s) for the process to stop and
then execute the start-program and wait (30s) for it to start. The
length of start or stop wait can be overridden using the 'timeout'
option. If Monit was unable to stop or start the service a failed alert
message will be sent if you have requested alert messages to be sent.
.PP
.Vb 5
\& check process apache with pidfile /var/run/httpd.pid
\&       start program = "/etc/init.d/httpd start" with timeout 60 seconds
\&       stop program  = "/etc/init.d/httpd stop"
\&       if failed port 80 for 2 cycles then restart
\&       if failed port 443 for 2 cycles then restart
.Ve
.PP
This example demonstrate how you can run a program as a specified user
(uid) and with a specified group (gid). Many daemon programs can do the
uid and gid switch by themselves, but for those programs that does not
(e.g. Java programs), monit's ability to start a program as a certain
user can be very useful. In this example we start the Tomcat Java
Servlet Engine as the standard \fInobody\fR user and group. Please note
that Monit can only switch uid and gid for the program if the
super-user is running Monit, otherwise Monit will simply ignore the
request to change uid and gid.
.PP
.Vb 7
\& check process tomcat with pidfile /var/run/tomcat.pid
\&       start program = "/etc/init.d/tomcat start"

\&             as uid 99 and with gid 99
\&       if failed port 8080 then alert
.Ve
.PP
In this example we use udp for connection testing to check if the
name-server is running:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& check process named with pidfile /var/run/named.pid
\&       start program = "/etc/init.d/named start"
\&       stop program  = "/etc/init.d/named stop"

The following example illustrates how to check if the service
\&'sophie' is answering connections on its Unix domain socket:

.PP
In this example we check an apache web-server running on
localhost which answers for several IP-based virtual hosts or
vhosts, hence the host statement before port:
.PP
.Vb 6
\& check process apache with pidfile /var/run/httpd.pid
\&       start "/etc/init.d/httpd start"

\&       if failed host chat.sol.no port 80 then alert
.Ve
.PP
To make sure that Monit is communicating with a \s-1HTTP\s0 server a
protocol test can be added:
.PP
.Vb 6
\& check process apache with pidfile /var/run/httpd.pid
\&       start "/etc/init.d/httpd start"
\&       stop  "/etc/init.d/httpd stop"
\&       if failed
\&          host www.sol.no port 80 protocol http

.PP
This example demonstrate a different way to check a web-server using
the send/expect mechanism:
.PP
.Vb 8
\& check process apache with pidfile /var/run/httpd.pid
\&       start "/etc/init.d/httpd start"
\&       stop  "/etc/init.d/httpd stop"

\&          expect "HTTP/[0\-9\e.]{3} 200.*"
\&       then alert
.Ve
.PP
Here we ping a remote host to check if it is up and if not, send an
alert:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& check host www.tildeslash.com with address www.tildeslash.com
\&       if failed ping then alert
.Ve
.PP
In the following example we ask Monit to compute and verify the
checksum for the underlying apache binary used by the start and
stop programs. If the checksum test should fail, monitoring will
be disabled to prevent possibly restarting a compromised binary:
.PP
.Vb 5
\& check process apache with pidfile /var/run/httpd.pid
\&       start program = "/etc/init.d/httpd start"

\&\fI~/.monitrc\fR
   Default run control file
.PP
\&\fI/etc/monitrc\fR
   If the control file is not found in the default
   location and /etc contains a \fImonitrc\fR file, this
   file will be used instead.
.PP
\&\fI./monitrc\fR
   If the control file is not found in either of the
   previous two locations, and the current working
   directory contains a \fImonitrc\fR file, this file is
   used instead.
.PP
\&\fI~/.monit.pid\fR
   Lock file to help prevent concurrent runs (non-root
   mode).
.PP
\&\fI/run/monit.pid\fR
   Lock file to help prevent concurrent runs (root mode,
   Linux systems, if /run directory is available).
.PP
\&\fI/var/run/monit.pid\fR
   Lock file to help prevent concurrent runs (root mode,
   Linux systems).
.PP
\&\fI/etc/monit.pid\fR
   Lock file to help prevent concurrent runs (root mode,
   systems without /var/run).
.PP
\&\fI~/.monit.state\fR
   Monit saves its state to this file and utilises
   information found in this file to recover from
   a crash. This is a binary file and its content is
   only of interest to monit. You may set the location
   of this file in the Monit control file or by using
   the \-s switch when Monit is started.
.PP
\&\fI~/.monit.id\fR
    Monit save its unique id to this file.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
No environment variables are used by Monit. However, when Monit
execute a script or a program Monit will set several environment
variables which can be utilised by the executable. The following
and \fIonly\fR the following environment variables are available:
.IP "\s-1MONIT_EVENT\s0" 4
.IX Item "MONIT_EVENT"
The event that occurred on the service
.IP "\s-1MONIT_DESCRIPTION\s0" 4
.IX Item "MONIT_DESCRIPTION"
A description of the error condition
.IP "\s-1MONIT_SERVICE\s0" 4
.IX Item "MONIT_SERVICE"
The name of the service (from monitrc) on which the event
occurred.
.IP "\s-1MONIT_DATE\s0" 4
.IX Item "MONIT_DATE"
The time and date (\s-1RFC 822\s0 style) the event occurred
.IP "\s-1MONIT_HOST\s0" 4
.IX Item "MONIT_HOST"
The host the event occurred on
.PP
The following environment variables are only available for
process service entries:
.IP "\s-1MONIT_PROCESS_PID\s0" 4
.IX Item "MONIT_PROCESS_PID"
The process pid. This may be 0 if the process was (re)started,
.IP "\s-1MONIT_PROCESS_MEMORY\s0" 4
.IX Item "MONIT_PROCESS_MEMORY"
Process memory. This may be 0 if the process was (re)started,
.IP "\s-1MONIT_PROCESS_CHILDREN\s0" 4
.IX Item "MONIT_PROCESS_CHILDREN"
Process children. This may be 0 if the process was (re)started,
.IP "\s-1MONIT_PROCESS_CPU_PERCENT\s0" 4
.IX Item "MONIT_PROCESS_CPU_PERCENT"
Process cpu%. This may be 0 if the process was (re)started,
.SH "SIGNALS"
.IX Header "SIGNALS"
If a Monit daemon is running, \s-1SIGUSR1\s0 wakes it up from its sleep
phase and forces a poll of all services. \s-1SIGTERM\s0 and \s-1SIGINT\s0 will
gracefully terminate a Monit daemon. The \s-1SIGTERM\s0 signal is sent
to a Monit daemon if Monit is started with the \fIquit\fR action
argument.
.PP
Sending a \s-1SIGHUP\s0 signal to a running Monit daemon will force
the daemon to reinitialise itself, specifically it will reread
configuration, close and reopen log files.
.PP
Running Monit in foreground while a background Monit daemon is
running will wake up the daemon.
.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
This is a very silent program. Use the \-v switch if you want to
see what Monit is doing, and tail \-f the log file. Optionally for
testing purposes; you can start Monit with the \-Iv switch. Monit
will then print debug information to the console, to stop monit
in this mode, simply press CTRL^C (i.e. \s-1SIGINT\s0) in the same
console.
.PP
The syntax (and parser) of the control file was inspired by Eric
S. Raymond et al.'s excellent fetchmail program. Some portions
of this man page also receive inspiration from the same authors.
